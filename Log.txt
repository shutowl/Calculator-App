All number and operational buttons were working and correctly displayed within an hour

> Included a "Clear" button for convenience of resetting the displayed value.
> An "Equal" button was also necessary for confirming two values.
> Also added a display that confirmed which operation was being used
and a display that shows the last number used/currently being used in the equation.
> Added project to github for version control among various devices.

> There seems to be an issue when inputting "equal" multiple times however and does not work as intended.

> Time spent: 1h 30m

Used other calculator apps as reference.
The one I used didn't allow for multiple "Equal" button presses, so I made it
so mine also doesn't allow for multiple "equal" button presses, which helped fix an issue.
