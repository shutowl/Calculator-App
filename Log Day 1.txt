2/15/22:

All number and operational buttons were working and correctly displayed within an hour

> Included a "Clear" button for convenience of resetting the displayed value.
> An "Equal" button was also necessary for confirming two values.
> Also added a display that confirmed which operation was being used
and a display that shows the last number used/currently being used in the equation.
> Added project to github for version control among various devices.

> There seems to be an issue when inputting "enter" multiple times however and does not work as intended.
